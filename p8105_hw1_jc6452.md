## description of *penguins* dataset

The *penguins* dataset includes the following 8 variables,
species,island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
body_mass_g, sex, and year. Some of the notable values of the variables
include is that the earliest year listed is 2007 and mean values for
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm and flipper_length_mm is 43.92, 17.15,
200.9, respectively. The penguins in this data set weigh an average of
4202g (4.202kg). The data set contains 344 rows and 8 columns total. The
mean flipper length is 200.9152mm, after removing the NA entries.

## creating penguins scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range

# Problem 2

## creating tibble

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  vector_logical = c(x>0),
  vector_character = c("this", "is", "P8105", "data", "science", "data", "wrangling", "homework", "one", "problem"),
  vector_factor = c("low", "high", "high", "medium", "medium", "low", "high", "high", "low", "medium")
)
sample = pull(df, x)
pull_VL = pull (df, vector_logical)
pull_VC = pull(df, vector_character)
pull_VF = pull(df, vector_factor)

mean(sample)
```

    ## [1] 0.0004128966

``` r
mean(pull_VL)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull_VC)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull_VC): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull_VF)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull_VF): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

The character vector and factor vector cannot be computed by the mean
function.

## numeric logical, character and factor vector

``` r
numeric_vl = as.numeric(pull_VL)
numeric_vc = as.numeric(pull_VC)
numeric_vf = as.numeric(pull_VF)

mean(numeric_vl)
mean(numeric_vc)
mean(numeric_vf)
```

According to the warning message, “NAs introduced by coercion” for both
`numeric_vc` and `numeric_vf`. Both the character vector and factor
vector, which has been applied with `as.numeric` function, outputted NA
when I tried to compute the mean. This is because these are string type
variables where the values inside the variable are string, a
descriptive, and non-numerical type variable. Unlike the two, logical
vector outputted mean of 0.5 as logical vector is boolean, hence its
output can be computed in numerical term (0 when FALSE and 1 when TRUE).
When viewing the `mean` function, there are methods for numeric/logical
vectors, and date, date-time and time interval objects. Therefore,
character and factor vectors cannot be computed while logical vectors
can be.
