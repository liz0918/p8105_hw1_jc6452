Describing `penguins` dataset

The \[penguins\] dataset includes the following 8 variables,
species,island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
body_mass_g, sex, and year. Some of the notable values of the variables
include is that the earliest year listed is 2007, so the oldest penguin
would be 17 years old. Some other notable values are the mean values for
bill_length, bill_depth and flipper_length is 43.92, 17.15, 200.9,
respectively. Surprisingly, the penguins weigh quite a bit with average
4202g (4.202kg). The dataset size is (344 x 8), which means in contains
8 columns and 344 rows total. The mean flipper length is 200.9152, after
removing the NA entries.

)
sample = pull(df, x)
vl = pull (df, vector_logical)
vc = pull(df, vector_character)
vf = pull(df, vector_factor)
